# HalfECB

The Half-ECB sample is a 100x100mm ECB card with connector. This is great for prototyping as you can get (at the time of writing) 10 PCBs in this size from SeeedStudio for about $5 (https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html)! This makes it less painful to get a start creating boards for the ECB.
